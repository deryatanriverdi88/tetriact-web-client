# TETRIACT

## What is TETRIACT?
TETRIACT is a Web-Based Tetris emulator built in a an arcade style.

A user can play the game, save their gamertags and scores, and see where they rank in the top ten.

### Motivation
I have always been a big fan of tetris and wanted to attempt to build it using react.  I also wanted to learn more about hooks, and a new way of styling which is why I chose to follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGOaCxX8HIU&t=322s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) for much of the game logic.


### Front-end

TETRIACT was built using React and uses React Hooks to create state and utilzie functional components. It uses the Styled Components Library for styling.
