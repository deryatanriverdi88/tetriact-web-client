### Motivation
I have always been a big fan of tetris and wanted to attempt to build it using react. I also wanted to learn more about hooks, and a new way of styling which is why I chose to follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGOaCxX8HIU&t=322s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) for much of the game logic.
